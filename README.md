# Train Schedule (Indian Railway)

This is my solution to the [Git-Heat Week-1 Problem](https://github.com/ietbitmesra/Git-Heat/tree/master/Week-1) organised by IET BIT Mesra.

- Input: 5 digit train number
- Output: JSON file containing train details and the route

- trainSchedule.py is a web scraper written in Python3
- Modules/packages used: requests, BeautifulSoup4
- To run the file, go to the command line and enter: python trainSchedule.py
