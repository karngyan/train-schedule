# Train Schedule (Indian Railway)

This is my solution to the [Git-Heat Week-1 Problem](https://github.com/ietbitmesra/Git-Heat/tree/master/Week-1) organised by IET BIT Mesra.

- Input: 5 digit train number
- Output: JSON file containing train details and the route

- trainSchedule.py is a web scraper written in Python3
- Modules/packages used: requests, BeautifulSoup4
- To run the file, go to the command line and enter: **python trainSchedule.py**

### Getting Started

>[Installing Python3](https://www.commonlounge.com/discussion/59b4cc482d6c4ebab9c3653cce230955)

The **requests** module doesn’t come with Python, so you’ll have to install it first. From the command line, run 
>**pip install requests**

The BeautifulSoup module’s name is **bs4** (for Beautiful Soup, version 4). From the command line, run 
>**pip install beautifulsoup4**


### Update
The **xlsxwriter** module doesn’t come with Python, so you’ll have to install it first. From the command line, run 
>**pip install xlsxwriter**
